# Short Script Programming Language
Short Script is designed to be easy and fast to interpret but powerful at the same time. Due to this, there is limited syntax checking and error handling but also extended features such as loading images and sound, gui drawing, and more.<br>
Available extended features as of current build:<br>
* ~~Loading images~~<br>
* ~~Loading sound~~<br>
* ~~Graphical screen~~<br>
* ~~GUI drawing~~<br>
* ~~Sprites~~<br>
* ~~Network transfers~~<br>
